- Folder GCons includes all the Geometric constraints including DP1, DP2, CD, and D
- simEngine3D.py includes the functions to add constraints and assemble Jacobian matrix
- simEngine3D_A7P1.py does Inverse Dynamics Analysis for 10 seconds and compute the reaction torques that can be finished in around 36s if tol = 1e-15
  * Results will be output to ./data folder as text files
  * A plotting function is also included to plot files from ./data folder

Used Liting's code as base for HW8. Run HW8_p1_final and HW8_p2_final for
HW8. Didn't finished part 1 and barely started part 2. Don't get to caught up
with giving a bad grade as this probably my most incomplete hw. I hope to 
improve in the future.
