Problem 1: did not fully understand how to set up the matrices.
Problem 2: did not know how to set up the prob. How to I get the coefficients and what overall equation do I use (Navier-Stokes?)?
Extra problems: I did the finite diff and finte volume problems before the official hw was publish in attempt to start the hw early. 
I decided to just include it since I already did the work. I will come to your office hours so you don't have to worry about giving much feedback.
